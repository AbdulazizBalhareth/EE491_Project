# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook detailing our project for EE491 - Intro to AI & ML. We developed machine learning models to predict heart disease using clinical data. 

## Project Overview
- **Objective**: To apply various ML algorithms to predict heart disease.
- **Models Used**: Random Forest, Neural Networks, SVM, among others.
- **Data**: Detailed in the notebook, with preprocessing steps and model training.

## Running the Notebook
- Ensure all dependencies are installed.
- Follow the steps in the notebook, from data loading to model evaluation.

## Results
- The notebook includes model evaluation metrics and visualizations.
- Comparative analysis with similar studies is also provided.

Feel free to explore the notebook and the methodologies used in this project.
